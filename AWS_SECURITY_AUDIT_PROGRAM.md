# AWS Security Audit Program

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive AWS Security Audit Program based on the AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar framework. The program is designed to systematically identify, assess, and remediate security risks across AWS environments through automated scanning and manual review processes.

## Program Overview

### Objectives
- Ensure compliance with AWS security best practices
- Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities proactively
- Maintain alignment with industry compliance frameworks (NIST, CIS, SOX, OWASP)
- Provide continuous security monitoring and improvement

### Scope
- All AWS accounts within the organization
- All AWS regions where resources are deployed
- All AWS services in use, with initial focus on IAM

### Frequency
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time for critical findings
- **Regular Scans**: Weekly automated scans
- **Comprehensive Audits**: Quarterly deep-dive assessments
- **Ad-hoc Scans**: As needed for incident response or changes

## Security Domains

### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

#### 1.1 Root Account Security
**Controls Tested:**
- Root account usage monitoring (last login < 90 days)
- MFA enforcement on root account
- Root account credential rotation
- Root account activity logging

**Risk Levels:**
- CRITICAL: Root account used recently without MFA
- HIGH: Root account has active access keys
- MEDIUM: Root account password not rotated

**Remediation Timeline:**
- CRITICAL: Immediate (within 24 hours)
- HIGH: Within 72 hours
- MEDIUM: Within 1 week

#### 1.2 User Account Management
**Controls Tested:**
- Inactive user detection (no activity > 90 days)
- Unused user accounts (never logged in)
- Users with both console and programmatic access
- Service accounts with console access
- MFA enforcement for all users

**Risk Levels:**
- HIGH: Active users without MFA
- MEDIUM: Inactive users with active credentials
- MEDIUM: Mixed access patterns (console + programmatic)
- LOW: Service accounts with unnecessary permissions

**Remediation Actions:**
- Disable inactive user credentials
- Remove unused user accounts
- Enforce MFA through policy attachment
- Separate human users from service accounts

#### 1.3 Access Key Management
**Controls Tested:**
- Access key age (rotation > 90 days)
- Multiple active access keys per user
- Access keys for root account
- Unused access keys

**Risk Levels:**
- CRITICAL: Root account access keys
- HIGH: Access keys older than 180 days
- MEDIUM: Access keys older than 90 days
- LOW: Multiple active keys without justification

**Remediation Process:**
1. Create new access key
2. Update all applications/services
3. Test new key functionality
4. Deactivate old key
5. Monitor for 24-48 hours
6. Delete old key

#### 1.4 Password Policy
**Controls Tested:**
- Minimum password length (≥ 14 characters)
- Password complexity requirements
- Password expiration (≤ 90 days)
- Password reuse prevention (≥ 5 passwords)
- User password change permissions

**Risk Levels:**
- HIGH: No password policy configured
- MEDIUM: Weak password requirements
- LOW: Suboptimal configuration

**Best Practice Configuration:**
```json
{
  "MinimumPasswordLength": 14,
  "RequireSymbols": true,
  "RequireNumbers": true,
  "RequireUppercaseCharacters": true,
  "RequireLowercaseCharacters": true,
  "AllowUsersToChangePassword": true,
  "MaxPasswordAge": 90,
  "PasswordReusePrevention": 5,
  "HardExpiry": false
}
```

#### 1.5 Privilege Management
**Controls Tested:**
- Users with administrative privileges
- Policies with wildcard actions (*)
- Policies with wildcard resources (*)
- Inline vs managed policies
- Policy attachment scope

**Risk Levels:**
- HIGH: Users with AdministratorAccess
- HIGH: Policies with unrestricted wildcards
- MEDIUM: Excessive inline policies
- LOW: Overly permissive managed policies

**Principle of Least Privilege:**
- Grant only required permissions
- Use specific actions instead of wildcards
- Scope resources appropriately
- Regular permission reviews

### 2. Future Security Domains (Roadmap)

- Bucket encryption
- Public access blocks
- Bucket policies
- Access logging
- Versioning and lifecycle

#### 2.2 Network Security (VPC)

- Internet gateway attachments
- VPN configurations
- Flow logs

#### 2.3 Compute Security (EC2)
- Instance metadata service v2
- EBS encryption
- Public IP assignments
- Instance profiles
- Systems Manager compliance

#### 2.4 Logging and Monitoring
- CloudTrail configuration
- Config rules compliance
- GuardDuty findings
- Security Hub standards
- CloudWatch alarms

## Audit Process

### Phase 1: Automated Scanning
1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   cd /home/ec2-user/aws-sec
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Execute Scan**
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=/home/ec2-user/aws-sec python -m src.cli scan
   ```

3. **Generate Reports**
   ```bash
   # HTML Report
   PYTHONPATH=/home/ec2-user/aws-sec python -m src.cli scan --output-format html --output-file audit_report.html
   
   # Markdown Report
   PYTHONPATH=/home/ec2-user/aws-sec python -m src.cli scan --output-format markdown --output-file audit_report.md
   ```

### Phase 2: Finding Analysis
1. **Prioritize by Risk Score**
   - CRITICAL (90-100): Immediate action
   - HIGH (70-89): Within 72 hours
   - MEDIUM (50-69): Within 1 week
   - LOW (30-49): Within 1 month

2. **Identify Quick Wins**
   - Findings with automated remediation
   - Low-impact changes
   - Policy updates

3. **Group Related Findings**
   - By service
   - By remediation type
   - By affected resources

### Phase 3: Remediation Planning
1. **Generate Remediation Scripts**
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=/home/ec2-user/aws-sec python -m src.cli scan --generate-remediation
   ```

2. **Review Scripts**
   - Validate remediation approach
   - Assess impact
   - Plan rollback procedures

3. **Execute Remediation**
   - Run in dry-run mode first
   - Apply changes incrementally
   - Document all actions

### Phase 4: Validation
1. **Re-scan Environment**
   - Verify findings resolved
   - Check for new issues
   - Update risk register

2. **Document Results**
   - Remediation actions taken
   - Remaining risks
   - Compensating controls
